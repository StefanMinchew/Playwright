Hi, I'm Stefan
This is my Playwright test playground

The reason behind the missing authenticate once functionality is because the demo site doesn't have any way to authenticate it therefore there is login function in almost every test.

The playground uses Page Object Model.
There is also github actions workflow triggering certain tests in certain conditions.
